If you have docker-compose installed this will start the redis server and start the django development server on port 8000
    docker-compose up

If you dont user docker-compose (which you should cause its awesome), you can just use docker to start the redis server
    sudo docker run --name redis --publish 6379:6379 -d redis

And then create a virtual env and run django from there manually:

To setup the development environment you should:
1) Create a new virtualenv
    python3 -m venv env

2) Activate it
    source env/bin/activate

3) Install requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Either run the server or run the tests with (redis has to be already running before running any of these steps)
    python manage.py tests
    python manage.py runserver
